# SFSU Fall 2018 CSC-648 Team 14 Project
### *[Gator Trader](http://sfsu-list.us.to/)*

My role in the team: Backend Lead 

The purpose of this project was to introduce students to the full lifecycle of software development, from the beginning
with the creation of high level requirements and use cases, to testing and quality assurance of a deliverable product. 

In its current state, the application does not have all the envisioned functionality / features implemented, and the user
interface needs polishing.
